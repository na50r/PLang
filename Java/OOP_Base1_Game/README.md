# Concept
* Entities refer to any living being in the fantasy world
* Each entity is has a certain hp & stamina value
* Each entity is blessed by the gods 
* The blessing modifies the hp & stamina attributes in a certain way
* There is a "fixed" number of blessings
* Blessings are chosen randomly upon creation of an entity
* There are now pure entity objects, entity will be the super class of all living beings, 
* Idea is, that beings like "monster" or "human" extend the entity class and perhaps have further Attributes/Methods 
* Stuck in design because Java is a mess, so I'll probably do it in Python
* Yes, I like isekai to some extend
